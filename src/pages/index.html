    text="<p>I enjoy exploring and implementing scalable solutions for front end design. I worked for roughly 10 years with global teams designing and building web applications for B2B, data & analytics, and digital marketing. From start to finish, my mind is on business requirements, user goals, optimal UI patterns, platform capacity and a true implementation of brand and visual styles. I have worked closely with the <a href='https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager.html?lang=en' target='_blank'>Adobe Experience Manager</a> platform, leading strategy around the use of its <a href='https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/authoring/siteandpage/style-system.html?lang=en' target='_blank'>style system</a> to support multiple themes. I help product teams validate their digital experience through wireframing, prototyping, and UX exploration. As a digital design, I cultivate collaboration around a reusable design system for designers as well as developers.</p><p>In my back pocket is my love for illustration, animation and music!</p>
