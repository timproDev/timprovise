    text="<p>I always seemed to be curious about how things are created. Working at the crossroads of design and front end development, I find myself rich with opportunities to explore, understand and improve the visual implementation of a digital experience. I work closely with business, design and development teams to support product UX/UI, front end development and integration. I have 6+ years experience doing this on <a href='https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager.html?lang=en' target='_blank'>Adobe Experience Manager</a>. I hold a strong understanding of how a brand’s visual styles can be translated into a scalable and adaptive presentation framework (SCSS/CSS) with modular style scope and the use of <a href='https://en.bem.info/methodology/=' target='_blank'>BEM methodology</a> — I tend to do my most effective designing <i>in-browser</i>. With AEM’s <a href='https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/authoring/siteandpage/style-system.html?lang=en' target='_blank'>style system</a>, I develop multi-product style and theme strategies that support the business and AEM authoring needs. Take a look at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/schletter/'>my LinkedIn</a> to see my experience, which includes @10 years designing and building web applications for B2B, data & analytics, and digital marketing across teams and global businesses.</p><p>I have contributed to <a href='https://pbskids.org/video/word-world/' target='_blank'>PBS's World World</a> as storyboard artist, composer and music supervisor. I have also created music and audio for mobile games, apps, and video production — and I create music for <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9386.Free_Play' target='_blank'>play!</a></p>
