    text="<p>I've had the pleasure to write, perform and co-produce this album. The Dell-hi’s is a rocksteady trio inspired by traditional Jamaican music of the 1960s and 1970s. In their debut EP So Follows The Dance, The Dell-Hi’s sing a message of love, life and truth in warm 3-part harmony backed by some of Brooklyn’s top rocksteady and reggae musicians. So Follows The Dance is a celebration of the sounds and rhythms of traditional rocksteady music that fill your hearts and move your feet.
