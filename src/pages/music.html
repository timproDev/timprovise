    title="<h1><span>.</span>music</h1>"
    text="<p>By placing speakers on her tummy (my home at this point in the story) that was playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty, my mom ensured that I was listening to music longer than I've technically been alive. I still play the tenor saxophone my grandfather bought me from a shop in Manhattan back in 1993. Nowadays I am a multi-instrumentalist, lyricist, composer, and performer working with musical acts, broadcast TV, mobile game development, and video production. I continue to explore, write and record in Brooklyn (and sometimes when I'm not in Brooklyn).</p>"

    label="Rocksteady Reggae"
    title="Hard to be true"
    text="<p>I've had the pleasure to write, perform and co-produce this album. The Dell-hi’s is a rocksteady trio inspired by traditional Jamaican music of the 1960s and 1970s. In their debut EP So Follows The Dance, The Dell-Hi’s sing a message of love, life and truth in warm 3-part harmony backed by some of Brooklyn’s top rocksteady and reggae musicians. So Follows The Dance is a celebration of the sounds and rhythms of traditional rocksteady music that fill your hearts and move your feet.</p>"

    label="Dream song"
    title="Linger & Lurk"
    text="<p>The theme of this song is akin to such songs as Stevie Wonder's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gkqGCnK-nw' target='_blank'>Creepin'</a> as it' i's about the haunting visits for people from your past via dreams. Stylistically this song is inspired by <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNYTYS_gnMY'>any of the many wonderful</a> tunes by Kenny Rankin.</p>"
